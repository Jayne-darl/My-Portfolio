          I am a software engineer interested in Artificial Intelligence and
          utilizing data to create innovative and transformational solutions. I
          have a bachelor's degree in Mathmatics and have worked with
          technologies for data science, mobile and web development. When I am
          not coding, you can catch me reading a book, sleeping or binging some
          TV shows on Netflix.
